# Exploring-survival-patterns-in-the-titanic-dataset

𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒋𝒆𝒄𝒕 𝑶𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒗𝒊𝒆𝒘:

The goal of this case study was to use machine learning techniques to evaluate Titanic passenger data and forecast survival outcomes. The objective was to develop a predictive model that assesses a passenger's chances of surviving by looking at a number of characteristics, including age, gender, class, and fare.



𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒃𝒍𝒆𝒎 𝑺𝒕𝒂𝒕𝒆𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕:

The objective was to create ML model that can accurately predict if a passenger survived the Titanic accident using available demographic and socioeconomic data. To achieve credible predictions, it was necessary to handle issues such as missing data, feature selection, and model validation.



𝑻𝒐𝒐𝒍𝒔 & 𝑻𝒆𝒄𝒉𝒏𝒐𝒍𝒐𝒈𝒊𝒆𝒔 𝑼𝒔𝒆𝒅:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Techniques: Logistic Regression, Data Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)



𝑲𝒆𝒚 𝑯𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒍𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕𝒔:

Data Preprocessing and EDA: Handled missing values, performed feature engineering, and conducted exploratory data analysis to understand data distributions and relationships.

Model Implementation: Utilized logistic regression to model the binary outcome of survival.

Visualization: Created visual representations of data distributions and model performance metrics to aid interpretation.

Model Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using accuracy scores and confusion matrices.



𝑾𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝑰 𝑳𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒏𝒆𝒅:

This project improved my knowledge of data preprocessing, particularly handling missing values and feature engineering. I obtained practical experience by building logistic regression models and understanding their coefficients. I also learned how important model evaluation metrics and visualization approaches are for properly validating and presenting prediction models.
